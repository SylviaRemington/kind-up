            <h2> Article Section - Peter Sharpe</h2>
            <p>Peter Sharpe is a “professional paradigm shifter”. Fiercely optimistic, he designs social experiments and
                global movements for peace that bend the rules of fear and challenge the modus operandi of community
                empowerment and flash mobs.</p>


            <p> Through his work leading The Liberators International, Peter creates spaces for the public to create
                their own threads of love, life and joy during the daily experience. One of his projects include the The
                World’s Biggest Eye Contact experiment which involved 100,000 participants from over 156 cities sharing
                a minute of eye contact with strangers.</p>

            <p>Ever thought that train rides can be a little weird? That the distance between us is vastly greater than
                the physical distance between us? What if we liberated our desire for human connection by daring to be
                vulnerable?</p>

            <p>This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a
                local community. Learn more at https://youtu.be/vRex3RKcQdk?si=mhPq-hU0EuLzfxaL</p>
